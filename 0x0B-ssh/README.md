SSH, or Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely connect to remote computers over an unsecured network. It provides a secure channel for accessing and managing remote systems, allowing users to execute commands on a remote machine, transfer files, and perform other network services securely.

Here are some key aspects of SSH:

Encryption: SSH encrypts all data sent between the client and server, including passwords, text, and file transfers. This encryption prevents eavesdropping and ensures that data remains confidential.
Authentication: SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to authenticate the user, providing strong protection against unauthorized access. Users can authenticate using passwords, public-key authentication, or other methods depending on the SSH configuration.
Remote Access: SSH provides a command-line interface (CLI) for remote access to the shell of a remote system. This allows users to execute commands on the remote machine as if they were physically present.
Secure File Transfer: SSH includes utilities such as SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) for securely transferring files between systems.
Port Forwarding: SSH supports port forwarding, allowing users to securely tunnel arbitrary network connections over the encrypted SSH connection, which can be useful for securely accessing services running on remote machines.
