Configuration management is the process of systematically managing changes to an organization's configuration items (CIs). Configuration items can include software, hardware, documentation, and other components that make up an organization's systems or products.

The main objectives of configuration management are:

Control: It ensures that changes to configuration items are identified, documented, evaluated, approved, and implemented in a controlled manner.
Visibility: It provides visibility into the state of configuration items, including their relationships and dependencies.
Traceability: It enables tracing the history of changes made to configuration items, which helps in understanding why certain configurations were chosen and what changes were made.
Verification and Auditability: It allows for verifying that the actual configuration matches the desired configuration and provides the ability to audit changes to ensure compliance with policies and standards.
